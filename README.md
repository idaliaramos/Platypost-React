 ## Inspiration
 While traveling I always found myself wanting to send postcards back to friends, but the process is quite tedious. You are on vacation and then have to try to find nice postcards (most of them are not great!) then try to find a post office to find stamps, wait in lines etc, its a waste of precious time. I wanted to make this as easy as possible for myself and other travelers to share their experiences is a more personalized way than generic postcards, hence platypost was born!
